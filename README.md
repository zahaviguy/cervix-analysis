# cervix-analysis

This is the final project for "Genomics and Bioinformatics Studies for Physicians" I took in Bar-Ilan University 2016-2017. It is a genetic algorithm intended to automatically classify images of the cervix into different categories. It was done for an online competition on Kaggle.com.
